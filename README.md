# fakenewsdetection
Fake News Detection is a machine learning project aimed at identifying whether a news article is real or fake using natural language processing techniques. The model is trained on the publicly available Kaggle dataset that includes labeled real and fake news articles, featuring attributes like title, text, and subject. We use preprocessing methods such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization, followed by models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and advanced deep learning methods like LSTM and BERT. The project achieves up to 97% accuracy using BERT. To run the project, clone the repository, install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt, and execute train_model.py. This project is useful for understanding how machine learning can be applied to combat misinformation and improve media credibility.
